# Transferring Credits to SNHU

SNHU is one of the most generous colleges when it comes to credits transfers. They allow you to transfer 45 credits towards an Associate’s degree and 90 towards a Bachelor's degree, saving you time and money in the long run. SNHU does accept credits from a large number of sources, some of which I will describe below. SNHU allows you to transfer credits whenever! For example, I took a single course at SNHU while I worked on two more at Sophia. Once I finished up the Sophia course, I transferred the credits over.

As a side note: I am a Computer Science major, this may not all apply to your degree path. Most of the information will!

## Sophia

https://snhu.sophia.org/

Sophia is my favorite way to earn credits in your free time. Instead of having a fee to pay per course you take, Sophia operates under a subscription-based model. They charge a monthly fee of $80 where you could gain access to their entire catalog of content. Most of the courses there could be finished from within a day to a month of work. The only downside is that their courses cover the general education courses and the free electives if you choose.

When I first started taking courses at Sophia, I reached out to my advisor. These courses are what my advisor told me I should take to fill up my general education:

### English:

English-122: English Composition 1
English-123: English Composition 2

### Mathematics:

MAT-136: Quantitative Analysis
MAT-240: Introduction to Statistics (Note: You can petition this course to become MAT-243 which is required for Comp Science degrees once you complete IT-140.)

### Fine Arts and Humanities (EFAH):

She told me any two under the Humanities category. Although, I recommend doing Ancient Greek Philosophers and Approaches to Studying Religions. Those were the fastest and easiest to complete.

### Social and Behavioral Sciences (ESBS):

PSY-108: Introduction to Psychology
SOC-112: Introduction to Sociology

### History (EHIS):

HIS-113: United States History 1
HIS-114: United States History 2

### Free Electives:

As for free electives, you have nine credits to do with as you please. For mine, I ended up transferring to three more courses from Sophia that were easy to do.

## Study.com

Study.com is similar to Sophia.org where they use the subscription-based model. Although, they charge $199 a month for their service. What is nice about Study is that they do not just offer general education courses, they also offer degree core courses. I have not used Study.com. From what I have been told is that if the course looks like it will transfer, the odds are it will. Although, that does need approval from your advisor first though.

## Certificates

Professional Certificates are both excellent for resumes and credits! SNHU accepts a wide variety of certificates ranging from CompTIA to edx.org. This route could be a fast way to get credits if you are planning on getting certificates already! A personal favorite of mine is the Google IT Support Certificate from Coursera. It is an easy course that I completed within the free week trial and transfers in for 12 credits. I ended up using mine in place of my concentration to save more time and money!

## Pathway to Math Success

https://www.snhu.edu/admission/transferring-credits/work-life-experience/testing-out

SNHU offers two different assessments for testing out of mathematics courses. Each pathway is a proctored exam that could take up to two hours to finish. Each test costs $50. The fee also gives you access to study material to help you prepare for the test. Each test you can take up to 5 times at no additional costs. Depending on how well you do, you’re able to test out of a couple of math classes!

First, there is a Calculus Pathway that counts towards MAT-136: Quantitative Analysis and MAT-140: Pre-Calculus. Then there is the Statistics Pathway which consists of MAT-133: Intro to Statistical Analysis and MAT-240: Applied Statistics. MAT-240 could be petitioned to become MAT-243 after completing IT-140 and talking to your advisor.
